===========
Trove Charm
===========

To add a service to Openstack to provide on-demand databases.

Problem Description
===================

As a cloud user I need be able to deploy a database that is scalable and
reliable quickly and easily without the burden of handling complex
administrative tasks.

Proposed Change
===============

One new charm - Trove with corresponding tests and QA CI/setup.

The new Trove charm should include, as a minimum, the following features:

- Deployable in a highly available configuration
- Allow clients and services to interact using SSL encryption
- Charm progress displayed via workload status

Alternatives
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    juju deploy {mysql,percona-cluster,cassandra,etc}

Implementation
==============

Assignee(s)
-----------

Primary assignee:
  unknown

Gerrit Topic
------------

Use Gerrit topic "trove" for all patches related to this spec.

.. code-block:: bash

    git-review -t trove

Work Items
----------

Provide Trove charm
+++++++++++++++++++

- Create skeleton charm layer based on OpenStack base layer and available
  interface layers to deploy Trove.
- Add support for upgrading Trove
- Add config option and accompanying support for upgrades via
  action-managed-upgrade.
- Add support for deploying Trove in a highly available configuration
- Add support for the Trove to display workload status
- Add support SSL endpoints
- Charm should have unit and functional tests.

Mojo specification deploying and testing Trove
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Write Mojo spec for deploying Trove in an HA configuration and testing
  creation of databases.

Repositories
------------

A new git repository will be required for the Trove charm:

.. code-block:: bash

    git://git.openstack.org/openstack/charm-trove

Documentation
-------------

The Trove charm should contain a README with instructions on deploying the
charm. A blog post is optional but would be a useful addition.

Security
--------

No additional security concerns.

Testing
-------

Code changes will be covered by unit tests; functional testing will be done
using a combination of Amulet, Bundle tester and Mojo specification.
