=========================
External Networking REDUX
=========================

Refactor neutron-gateway and neutron-openvswitch charms to support more
flexible configuration of 'external' north/south traffic routing to
tenant networks.

Problem Description
===================

The neutron-gateway and neutron-openvswitch charms currently support the
'ext-port' configuration option to plumb the Open vSwitch br-ex bridge
into the external/public network.

OpenStack switched to a more flexible way of doing this a few cycles back,
and the use of the default 'br-ex' == external network approach is
officially deprecated.

We need to refactor the charms to support the reference way of configuring
external networking, which provides more flexibility than the current
approach but does require more knowledge of Neutron.

Use Cases
---------

Using the reference approach to external networking, its possible to have
multiple external networks served from the same set of neutron gateway
units, potentially on the same physical network with VLAN segmentation:

.. code-block:: bash

    neutron net-create --provider:network_type vlan \
                       --provider:segmentation_id 400 \
                       --provider:physical_network physnet1 --shared external

    neutron net-create --provider:network_type vlan \
                       --provider:segmentation_id 401 \
                       --provider:physical_network physnet1 --shared \
                       --router:external=true floating

    neutron router-gateway-set provider floating


with the associated neutron-gateway configuration:

.. code-block:: bash

    neutron-gateway:
        bridge-mappings:         physnet1:br-data
        data-port:               br-data:eth1

Proposed Change
===============

Both the neutron-gateway and neutron-openvswitch charms will need to be
updated to support this change; for now the 'ext-port' configuration will
be deprecated for backwards compatibility with existing installations
preserving current behaviour.

The existing 'data-port' configuration option will be used instead to
configure bridge-mappings and connectivity to physical network ports
on the units deployed.

Alternatives
------------

No alternatives.
